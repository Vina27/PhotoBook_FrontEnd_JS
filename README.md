# PhotoBook_FrontEnd_JS

Photo Book 

This app was built using Rails [6.0] as a Backend to store and retrieve data using a PostgreSQL database. The Frontend is built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Custom CSS. 

This application allows a user to create a Photo Book by clicking on the “Add Photo” button which opens a form for the user. The first line of the form allows the user to input a “Description” (Travel, Food, Family, etc). The second line of the form allows the user to input a "A photo image URL", that is displayed once the user clicks on the red “Add  photo” button. Other user functionality include "Editing description" of an added photo and deleting a photo and its description from the Photo Book!
