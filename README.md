# PhotoBook_FrontEnd_JS

Photo Book 

This app is built using Rails [6.0] as a Backend to store and retrieve data using a PostgreSQL database. The Frontend is built using Vanilla JavaScript and Custom CSS. 

This application allows a user to create a photo book by clicking on the “Add Photo” button which opens a form for the User. The first line of the form allows the User to select a “Description” from the drop down box. The second line of the form allows the User to input a URL image link, that is displayed once the User clicks on the “Add  photo” button. Other user functionality includes deleting a photo from the photo book and updating the photo information.
